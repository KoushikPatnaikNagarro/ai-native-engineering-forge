- Annotate accessibility guidelines (WCAG compliance).
- Export all necessary assets (icons, images, graphics).
- Prepare clear handoff documentation (design files, user flows, component usage).
- Ensure all deliverables are ready for efficient developer handoff and implementation.
**Format**: json file
**Usage**: Boundary conditions for technical decisions

## Analysis Process

### 1. User-Centered Requirements Analysis
- Deeply review business objectives, user personas, and success criteria.
- Identify user needs, pain points, and desired outcomes.
- Map user roles to functional and non-functional requirements.
- Document constraints, assumptions, and accessibility needs.

### 2. Functional & Workflow Mapping
- Analyze the functional overview to understand all user journeys and workflows.
- Break down features by user type and interaction complexity.
- Visualize end-to-end user flows and map them to technical requirements.
- Identify opportunities for usability improvements and intuitive navigation.

### 3. Design Feasibility & Technical Alignment
- Assess design constraints, technology stack, and integration needs.
- Evaluate screen/UI complexity, scalability, and performance requirements.
- Ensure proposed solutions are technically feasible and align with business goals.
- Consider security, compliance, and deployment needs.

### 4. Iterative Prototyping & Validation
- Rapidly prototype wireframes and high-fidelity mockups using design tokens.
- Collaborate with stakeholders and developers for feedback and alignment.
- Conduct usability reviews and iterate on designs for optimal user experience.
- Validate accessibility (WCAG) and responsive design across devices.

### 5. Handoff & Implementation Readiness
- Prepare detailed design specifications and component documentation.
- Export all necessary assets and design files for development.
- Provide clear handoff documentation and support for implementation.
- Ensure all deliverables are ready for efficient developer handoff and future scalability.

## Output Deliverables

**Output Location**: All design deliverables should be placed in `{DESIGN_DOC_PATH}`
Set the respective variables for the path to these deliverables in prompt_config.md and reuse wherever required

### 1. User Flows & Journey Maps 
- Visual diagrams mapping key user journeys and interactions based on requirements and personas.

### 2. Wireframes 
- Low-fidelity layouts for all required screens/pages, focusing on structure and usability.

### 3. High-Fidelity Mockups
- Pixel-perfect screen designs using provided design tokens for colors, typography, and spacing.

### 4. Interactive Prototypes
