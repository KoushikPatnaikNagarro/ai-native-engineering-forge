**Usage**: Design foundation for implementing UI components required by the specific user story

### Input 3: Task Breakdown
**Parameter Name**: `TASK_BREAKDOWN`
**Description**: CSV file containing all user stories with detailed information
**Usage**: Source for extracting the specific user story details, acceptance criteria, and dependencies

### Input 4: User Story Identification
**Parameter Name**: `USER_STORY_ID`
**Description**: Specific user story identifier (e.g., "US001", "S01") to implement
**Usage**: Identifies exactly which user story to implement from the task breakdown

### Input 5: Project Name
**Parameter Name**: `PROJECT_NAME`

**Usage**: File naming, package configuration, and documentation references

## Analysis Process

### 1. User Story Extraction and Analysis
- **Parse Task Breakdown**: Extract the specific user story details from TASK_BREAKDOWN using USER_STORY_ID
- **Acceptance Criteria Review**: Identify all AC (Acceptance Criteria) items that must be satisfied
- **Definition of Done**: Understand what constitutes completion for this specific story
- **Dependency Analysis**: Check if this story depends on other stories and their implementation status
- **Epic Context**: Understand the broader epic this story belongs to for architectural context

### 2. Codebase Assessment and Implementation Strategy
- **Existing Code Evaluation**: Assess current project state and existing implementations
- **Implementation Scope**: Determine minimal changes needed to satisfy the user story requirements
- **Design System Integration**: Identify required design components from the design specifications
- **Technical Dependencies**: Identify any setup or infrastructure needed for this specific story
- **Testing Requirements**: Plan testing strategy specific to the user story acceptance criteria

### 3. Incremental Development Approach
- **Minimal Viable Implementation**: Implement only what's needed for the specific user story
- **Existing Code Integration**: Build upon existing codebase without breaking existing functionality
- **Component Reuse**: Leverage existing components where possible, create new ones only as needed
- **State Management**: Extend existing state management patterns or implement minimal state for the story
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure implementation works independently and enhances overall application

### 4. Quality Assurance and Story Validation
- **Acceptance Criteria Verification**: Ensure every AC item is implemented and testable
- **Design Compliance**: Validate implementation matches design specifications for relevant components
- **User Experience Testing**: Verify the user story delivers the intended user value
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure new implementation doesn't break existing functionality

## Implementation Guidelines

### User Story Parsing Logic
```
1. Read TASK_BREAKDOWN file
2. Find row where "Story ID" column matches USER_STORY_ID
3. Extract: Epic ID, Subject, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Definition of Done, Priority, Dependencies
4. Parse Acceptance Criteria (AC01, AC02, etc.) into individual requirements
5. Check Epic dependencies and prerequisites
```
