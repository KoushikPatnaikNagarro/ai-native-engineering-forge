# Note-Taking App Requirements

## 1. Objective

Provide a lightweight note-taking app where users can quickly capture structured notes with headings, sub-headings, and due dates. The app emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and time-awareness, helping users not only capture notes but also stay mindful of approaching or past deadlines.

## 2. Persona / User Role

**Note Taker**

Anyone who needs to jot down short, structured notes and track them against due dates.

**Goal:** create notes effortlessly, recall them quickly, and know which ones are urgent or overdue.

## 3. Core Functional Expectations

- **Add a Note:** Each note has a heading, sub-heading, and due date.
- **Edit Note:** Notes can be edited after creation.
- **View Notes:** Notes are listed as cards, showing:
  - Heading
  - Sub-heading
  - Due date
  - Days to due date (e.g., "Due in 3 days", "Overdue by 1 day").
- **Sorting:**
  - Default — chronological order of creation.
  - Optional — sorted by due date.
- **Status Indicator:** Notes past their due date are clearly flagged (e.g., red highlight or "Overdue").

## 4. Constraints and Assumptions

### Constraints:
- No login/authentication; instantly usable.
- Minimalist feature set (no tags, folders, rich formatting, sharing).
- Limited to basic CRUD (create, read, update) with time awareness.

### Assumptions:
- Users want quick note capture with lightweight structure.
- Due dates are used primarily for awareness, not complex scheduling.
- Visual clarity (days remaining, overdue flag) is more valuable than heavy task management.

## 5. Success Criteria

- **Ease of Use:** Easy note creation without any friction
- **Clarity:** Every card clearly shows its due date status (upcoming, due today, overdue).
- **Retrieval:** Users can find notes easily via chronological or due date sort.
- **Update Flow:** Notes can be edited and saved with minimal steps.
- **Awareness:** Users reliably notice which notes are overdue without extra clicks.
