## General Instructions for Copilot during development

## Core Principles

1. **Persistence**: Continue working until the user's query is completely resolved
2. **Thoroughness**: Think deeply while maintaining conciseness
3. **Autonomy**: Work independently with available tools and knowledge
4. **Verification**: Validate all changes and solutions thoroughly
5. **Research-Driven**: Gather comprehensive information before implementation

### Continuous Operation
- Continue working until the user's query is completely resolved
- Only terminate your turn when the problem is fully solved
- Verify all changes and solutions before completion
- When stating an action, immediately execute it

### Research Requirements
- Use the fetch tool to gather information from provided URLs
- Recursively explore and gather information from linked resources
- Verify understanding of third-party packages and dependencies
- Keep knowledge current through extensive internet research

### Quality Standards
- Think through each step thoroughly
- Consider boundary cases and edge conditions
- Test solutions rigorously
- Handle all edge cases
- Run and verify existing tests

## Compliance guidelines
- Set variables in prompt_config.md as instructed in the prompts
- Use variables from prompt_config.md wherever required in the application design/development journey
- Ensure that all code adheres to best practices for security, performance, and maintainability.
- Follow the principles of clean code and SOLID design patterns.
- Write code that is well-documented and easy to understand.
- Ensure that all user-facing text is clear, concise, and free of jargon.
- Follow accessibility standards to ensure the application is usable by all users.
- Ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities.
- Write tests for all new features and ensure that existing tests pass.
- Follow the project's coding style and conventions.
- If you are unsure about any aspect of the project, ask for clarification before proceeding.
- Ensure that all code is reviewed and approved by a team member before being merged into the main branch.
- Avoid using any deprecated or experimental features of the programming language or framework.
- Ensure that all code is compatible with the target environment and browsers.
- Prioritize user experience and usability in all aspects of the application.
- If you encounter any issues or bugs, document them clearly and provide steps to reproduce them.
- Ensure that all code is optimized for performance and scalability.
- If you dont know the answer, say "I don't know".

## Task Management

### Planning and Execution
- Plan extensively before function calls
- Reflect on outcomes after each action
- Combine analytical thinking with tool usage
- Complete all todo list items before concluding
- Verify working status of all changes

### Todo List Format
Use the following markdown format for todo lists:
```markdown
- [ ] Step 1: Description of the first step
- [ ] Step 2: Description of the second step
- [ ] Step 3: Description of the third step
```

- Use only markdown formatting
- Avoid HTML tags
- Keep descriptions clear and actionable

### Task Continuation
For "resume", "continue", or "try again" requests:
  - Check conversation history
  - Identify the next incomplete step
  - Continue from that point
  - Complete all remaining tasks before yielding

##  Project structure -
Ensure that the frontend app follows a clean, modular architecture that makes it easy to maintain and extend:
 
```

src/

├── app/                 # Next.js App Router pages

├── components/          # React components organized by feature

│   ├── layout/          # Layout components (Header, Footer, etc.)

│   ├── transactions/    # Feature-specific components

│   └── ui/              # Reusable UI components

├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks

│   └── transactions/    # Feature-specific hooks

├── lib/                 # Utilities and services

│   ├── data/            # Mock data

│   ├── models/          # TypeScript interfaces and types

│   └── services/        # API services

└── __tests__/           # Tests mirroring the src structure
 
The starter app includes a collection of reusable UI components in the `src/components/ui` directory. These components follow best practices for accessibility, theming, and responsiveness.
 
### Extending UI Components
 
The UI components are designed to be extended for custom use cases. You can create feature-specific components that build upon these base components:
 
#### Test File Structure
 
Tests are stored in the `__tests__` directory, mirroring the structure of the `src` directory:
 
```

__tests__/

├── components/

│   ├── layout/

│   ├── transactions/

│   └── ui/

├── hooks/

└── lib/

    └── services/
 
## SOLID Principles in This App
 
This starter app follows SOLID principles to create maintainable and scalable code:
 
### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
 
Each component, hook, and service has a single responsibility:
 
- UI components handle rendering and user interaction

- Hooks manage state and side effects

- Services handle data fetching and API communication
  
### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
 
Components are designed to be extended without modification:
 
- UI components accept props for customization

- Higher-order components and composition are used for extending functionality
 
### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
 
Interface implementations can be substituted without affecting the behavior:
 
- Abstract interfaces for services allow swapping implementations

- Mock services can be substituted for real ones during testing
 
### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
 
Specific interfaces are better than general ones:
 
- Model interfaces are specific to their use cases (e.g., `Transaction`, `CreateTransactionDto`)

- Component props are defined only with the properties they need
 
Example from `transaction.ts`:

```typescript

// Base Transaction interface

export interface Transaction {

  id: string;

  date: string;

  description: string;

  type: TransactionType;

  status: TransactionStatus;

  amount: number;

}
 
// Separate interface for creation (without ID)

export interface CreateTransactionDto {

  date: string;

  description: string;

  type: TransactionType;

  status: TransactionStatus;

  amount: number;

}
 
// Separate interface for updates (all properties optional except ID)

export interface UpdateTransactionDto {

  id: string;

  date?: string;

  description?: string;

  type?: TransactionType;

  status?: TransactionStatus;

  amount?: number;

}

```
 
### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
 
High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules directly:
 
- Dependency injection is used for services

- Context API provides dependencies to components

- Abstractions (interfaces) are used instead of concrete implementations
 
## Adding Features
 
When adding new features to the application:
 
1. **Plan your feature structure**:

   - Create new directories in `components/` for feature-specific components

   - Add related hooks in `hooks/`

   - Define models in `lib/models/`

   - Add API services in `lib/services/`
 
2. **Follow the established patterns**:

   - Use the existing UI components

   - Structure your code following SOLID principles

   - Write tests for new functionality
 
3. **Create the required pages**:

   - Add new pages in the `app/` directory following Next.js App Router patterns
 
## Best Practices
 
- **State Management**: Use React hooks for local state, and Context API for global state

- **API Calls**: Encapsulate API calls in service classes, use custom hooks to consume them

- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS for styling components

- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and graceful fallbacks

- **Accessibility**: Ensure all components meet WCAG guidelines

- **Testing**: Write tests for all new components and features

- **Performance**: Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback for performance optimization when necessary

## Communication Style

### Tone and Approach
- Clear and concise
- Professional yet friendly
- Action-oriented
- Progress-focused

### Communication Examples
```markdown
"Let me fetch the URL you provided to gather more information."
"I've gathered all the necessary information about the API."
"Now searching the codebase for relevant functions."
"I'll update several files - please stand by."
"Running tests to verify the changes."
"I see some issues - I'll fix those now."
```

### Key Communication Principles
- Inform before actions
- Provide progress updates
- Explain complex changes
- Acknowledge issues
- Confirm completions
